## About this modpack ##
After we played 1.8 combat version very frequently, we felt 1.8 is very tired and most of all, the support for 1.8 ended already after 1.9 was released.
Because of that, we planned to create alternative modpack derived from similar concept from Solaire, which uses Fabric and latest version of Minecraft to support more servers which requires latest Minecraft server to join. This modpack targets both normal and pvp Minecraft players, while Solaire focuses on pure classic PvP modpack.

Solaire focuses on less-bloated and simple modpack which anyone can add their own mods and resource packs without limitation.

## Caution when using this modpack ##
We recommend using only mods which is safe to use on server. Avoid using mods which gains advantage than other players. We are not responsible for any bans from the server for using mods which gives you unfair advantages.

## How does it works? ##
Solaire works as pure Fabric, which allows you to add mods and resource packs freely, and does not include any Fabric modifications.
Due to modpack usage copyright difference between mods, we decided not to include any mods. You must install Fabric and put jar file into mods folder manually.
